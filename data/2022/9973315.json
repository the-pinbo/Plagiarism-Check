However, the actual concept and targeted research on MFCs began in the 2000s.</p><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3a\"><h3>A. Evolution of MFCS</h3><p>An MFC uses the basic concept of a Galvanic Cell, which generates electrical energy directly from chemical energy with the aid of microorganisms <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref5\" id=\"context_ref_5_3a\">[5]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref6\" id=\"context_ref_6_3a\">[6]</a>. The term MFC was first proposed in 1962 by Davis and Yarbrough in their paper \u201cPreliminary Experiment on a Microbial Fuel Cell.\u201d They observed that microbes react with hydrocarbons to produce electrical energy <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref7\" id=\"context_ref_7_3a\">[7]</a>. However, the initial research that led to MFC began in the early 18th century with the birth of galvanic cells by Luigi Galvani. The idea of generating electricity from chemical reactions was started by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta at the end of the 18th century <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref8\" id=\"context_ref_8_3a\">[8]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref12\" id=\"context_ref_12_3a\">[12]</a>.</p><p>However, the idea of using microorganisms to generate electricity was initiated by Potter <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref13\" id=\"context_ref_13_3a\">[13]</a> in 1911 with the experimental setup illustrated by the author in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig5\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 5</a>. In his experiment, the nutrient fluid was filled with a microorganism culture in a glass jar. A platinum electrode was immersed inside the nutrient fluid, which acted as the anode. The same material was used as a cathode dipped into the liquid inside the porous cylinder, which acted as a proton exchange membrane (PEM). When the C-A terminal is closed, current flows from the cathode to the anode, charging the capacitor. When the C-B terminal of the switch is closed, the capacitor is discharged through a galvanometer <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref13\" id=\"context_ref_13_3a\">[13]</a>. However, no analysis has been performed to understand the details of the proton and electron transfer mechanisms.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig5\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share5-3227433-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig5\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share5-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 5. - MFC by M.C.

In this experiment, a different type of reactor was designed and divided into three main parts. The left-hand side is called a biological half-cell, supplied with continuous nitrogen. The middle part is called the buffer zone and is bubbled with Oxygen-free Nitrogen to prevent oxygen from reaching the biological half-cell. The right-hand side is called the oxygen half-cell, bubbled continuously with oxygen. All three compartments were filled with 1% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) with 0.05 M Phosphate buffer at pH 7. The researchers reported three different types of experiments using (a) Glucose Oxidase, (b) Escherichia Coli, and (c) Nocardia as added microbes in the glucose substrate using a 1000 ohms load. The experiment shows that using microorganisms generates a higher voltage than the usual solution <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref7\" id=\"context_ref_7_3a\">[7]</a>.

Advantages and Disadvantages of MFCS</h3><p>The most notable advantage of MFC is that they can simultaneously remove pollutants by purifying wastewater while producing electrical energy. It is estimated that wastewater treatment plants contain approximately 930% more power compared to the power used by the total operations <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref16\" id=\"context_ref_16_3b\">[16]</a>. Reference <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref17\" id=\"context_ref_17_3b\">[17]</a> demonstrated the use of a two-chamber MFC to generate 107% electrical energy in a brewery wastewater plant compared to the operational energy required for an overall Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal of 91.88%. Reference <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref18\" id=\"context_ref_18_3b\">[18]</a> showed that an air cathode MFC composed of a carbon brush anode with a twisted titanium wire and platinum-coated carbon cloth cathode managed to remove 89 +1.4% of total COD and 78 +1.5% of soluble COD at 1.25 organic load in the seafood processing industry in Saudi Arabia, with the highest power density of 530 +2.4 mW/<inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{m}^{2}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>.</p><p>Another significant advantage of MFCs is that they can operate under mild temperatures and pH conditions <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref19\" id=\"context_ref_19_3b\">[19]</a>. Temperature is the most vital parameter to be maintained to achieve an optimal output in any MFC system. The MFC operates well at room temperature to achieve its optimal output. The average temperature reported for MFC operation is approximately 20\u2013<inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$32~^{\\circ }\\text{C}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref20\" id=\"context_ref_20_3b\">[20]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref25\" id=\"context_ref_25_3b\">[25]</a>. Generally, most bacteria used in MFCs can achieve optimal growth at one or two pH units from a neutral value of 7.0 <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref26\" id=\"context_ref_26_3b\">[26]</a>. This value is favorable for MFC development using wastewater, where the pH for most wastewater is near-neutral and varies between 6.0\u20138.0 <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref27\" id=\"context_ref_27_3b\">[27]</a>. Another unique advantage of MFC over other fuel cells is their ease of customizability. In an MFC, the optimal output can be reached by adjusting \n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><li><p>reactor size and configuration</p></li><li><p>reactor volume</p></li><li><p>electrode type and size</p></li><li><p>membrane type and size</p></li><li><p>substrate composition</p></li><li><p>catalyst</p></li><li><p>pH value and</p></li><li><p>temperature</p></li></ul></p><p>These unique characteristics have opened a wide area of research into MFC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref2\" id=\"context_ref_2_3b\">[2]</a>. Other advantages of MFCs are <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref28\" id=\"context_ref_28_3b\">[28]</a>,\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><li><p>direct chemical to electrical energy generation</p></li><li><p>no sludge aeration</p></li><li><p>easy installation in a rural area</p></li><li><p>lower sludge treatment</p></li><li><p>easy monitoring</p></li><li><p>self-regeneration of microorganisms</p></li><li><p>low carbon footprint, and</p></li><li><p>water reclamation</p></li></ul></p><p>Even though MFC have enormous advantages, some limitations still hinder their access to the commercial market <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_3b\">[3]</a>. Two significant limitations in MFC development are (a) ultralow power generation and (b) high-cost materials. The highest Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) generated by a single cell of MFC is only 1.1V. However, in practice, this value is reported to be around 0.2 V to 0.8 V <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref29\" id=\"context_ref_29_3b\">[29]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref30\" id=\"context_ref_30_3b\">[30]</a> due to the significant losses/ overpotential in the system, such as ohmic losses, activation losses, and concentration losses <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref4\" id=\"context_ref_4_3b\">[4]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref31\" id=\"context_ref_31_3b\">[31]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref34\" id=\"context_ref_34_3b\">[34]</a>. At the same time, the internal resistance is also very high because of the redox reaction, which reduces the MFC output power (P <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=\\,\\,\\text{V}^{2}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> /R). Therefore, the potential difference between the electrodes must be increased to improve power generation or the internal resistance should be reduced. Removing the membrane, modifying the reactor configuration, scaling up, and stacking several units in series or parallel have been attempted to strengthen power generation from MFC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref2\" id=\"context_ref_2_3b\">[2]</a>. However, building a large-scale MFC or simply connecting several units of MFCs in series or parallel cannot produce enormous output power without an optimal power management system to support the energy harvesting process in MFC design <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref35\" id=\"context_ref_35_3b\">[35]</a>.</p><p>Another major drawback of the MFC design is its high material cost. A basic MFC consists of reactors (anodic and cathodic), electrodes, PEM, substrates, mediators, and microorganisms <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref36\" id=\"context_ref_36_3b\">[36]</a>. Thus, many system design modifications have been considered to reduce the material cost, such as reducing from two chambers to a single chamber, using low-cost electrodes, membrane-less MFC, and mediator-less MFC. Liu H. and Logan. B.E. <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref37\" id=\"context_ref_37_3b\">[37]</a> introduced an air cathode MFC with only a single anodic chamber (single-chamber MFC) and without a proton exchange membrane to reduce the material cost. Mediator-less MFCs have been introduced when exoelectrogens such as <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> (KN400) were found suitable for MFCs <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref38\" id=\"context_ref_38_3b\">[38]</a>. This microorganism can transfer electrons directly to electrodes using nanowires <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref39\" id=\"context_ref_39_3b\">[39]</a>. However, the cost remains a significant issue in MFC design with ultralow power generation. Other limitations of MFCs include high internal resistance, high dissolved oxygen permeability, membrane fouling, electrochemical limitations, and mass transport limitations <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref36\" id=\"context_ref_36_3b\">[36]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref40\" id=\"context_ref_40_3b\">[40]</a>. <a ref-type=\"table\" anchor=\"table1\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Table 1</a> summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of MFC.<div class=\"figure figure-full table\" id=\"table1\"><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">TABLE 1 </b>\nAdvantages and Limitations of MFC</div><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share.t1-3227433-large.gif\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share.t1-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"Table 1- &#10;Advantages and Limitations of MFC\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div></div></p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3c\"><h3>C. Factors That Influence MFC Performance</h3><p>Generally, many biological, chemical, physical, and electrical parameters influence the electricity generation in MFC. A powerful MFC-based energy-harvesting system can be developed if these parameters are optimally maintained with sufficient modifications and existing resources <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_3c\">[3]</a>. The substrate concentration and reactor design are the most important elements influencing the output of MFCs. Temperature, pH, type of microorganism, substrate mixing, membrane selection, and feeding duration were also reported as other elements.</p><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3c1\"><h4>1) Substrate Concentration</h4><p>The substrate concentration is a significant element that determines energy generation in MFC. Many studies have highlighted that an increase in the substrate concentration increases the power density in MFC, regardless of the reactor design. For example, Ni et al. tested three different concentrations of swine wastewater to study the effect of substrate concentration on MFC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref41\" id=\"context_ref_41_3c1\">[41]</a>.

In a similar work, Tee et al. stated that the ideal operating temperature for an MFC-adsorption hybrid system is 35 \u00b0C <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref46\" id=\"context_ref_46_3c2\">[46]</a>.

Reference <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref50\" id=\"context_ref_50_3c3\">[50]</a> reported that the optimal pH value for ideal MFC performance is between 8\u201310. The effect of anodic pH was investigated by varying the pH from 3\u201313 using a marine consortia-based dual-chamber MFC. In related work, Raghavulu et al. <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref51\" id=\"context_ref_51_3c3\">[51]</a> used acidophilic (pH <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=6$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>), neutral (pH <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=7$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>), and alkaline (pH <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=8$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>) in the experiment and reported that acidophilic (pH <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$=6$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>) gave the best result compared to pH 7 and 8. This result contradicts recent research, which suggests that pH 8\u201310 is the best value for optimal performance. The latest research from T. E. Igboamalu et al. <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref52\" id=\"context_ref_52_3c3\">[52]</a> supported the work reported in <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref50\" id=\"context_ref_50_3c3\">[50]</a> and <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref51\" id=\"context_ref_51_3c3\">[51]</a> and concluded that the initial pH value plays an essential role in determining the performance of the MFC. Reference <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref52\" id=\"context_ref_52_3c3\">[52]</a> strongly agreed that an initial pH value below seven or above nine will produce higher proton liberation, causing the accumulation of more positive ions in the anode chamber, increased internal resistance, and reduced power generation. <a ref-type=\"table\" anchor=\"table3\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Table 3</a> shows the latest studies that showcase the effect of pH on MFC performance, clearly indicating that the optimal pH value for the MFC system is between 6\u20139.<div class=\"figure figure-full table\" id=\"table3\"><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">TABLE 3 </b>\npH Value for Optimal Microbial Growth in MFC</div><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share.t3-3227433-large.gif\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share.t3-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"Table 3- &#10;pH Value for Optimal Microbial Growth in MFC\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div></div></p></div></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d\"><h3>D. Fault in MFC and Detection Method</h3><p>Faults in electrochemical systems are common. In MFC, the main fault is caused by the failure of hardware malfunction.</p><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d1\"><h4>1) Common Faults Detected in MFCS</h4><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d1a\"><h5>a: Biofouling Development</h5><p>Biofouling is a phenomenon in which biofilms form on moist surfaces. Therefore, in MFC, biofilms commonly develop on the cathode surface and PEM. Biofilm formation in the cathode can reduce electron transfer to the cathodic substrate, thereby lowering the reduction process in the cathodic chamber <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref55\" id=\"context_ref_55_3d1a\">[55]</a>. The PEM is the intermediate layer between the anodic and cathodic chambers, allowing proton transfer to the cathodic chamber during the reduction process. Thus, when a PEM fails, it reduces the cation transfer rate to the cathodic chamber and causes a decrease in the overall performance. Nafion 117 has excellent antifouling capacity, lower internal resistance, and higher conductivity to cations and is the most used PEM in MFC designs <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref56\" id=\"context_ref_56_3d1a\">[56]</a>.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d1b\"><h5>b: Electrode Corrosion</h5><p>An MFC is an electrochemical system that transfers electrons from one metal (anode) to another (cathode) through an external wire. Copper is commonly used as an external wire, while various metals have been used as electrodes in MFCs. Therefore, corrosion of the copper wire and electrodes in the MFC can increase the internal resistance, thus affecting the power generation in MFC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref56\" id=\"context_ref_56_3d1b\">[56]</a>.</p><p>Owing to the ultra-low power generation in MFC, stacking up several units in series or parallel is suggested as a promising technique to increase the performance of MFC. However, connecting one or more units in series or parallel can cause a voltage reversal in one or more unit cells. This phenomenon can generate bio-anode corrosion in stacked MFC and affect the overall system performance <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref29\" id=\"context_ref_29_3d1b\">[29]</a>.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d1c\"><h5>c: Supporting Equipment Failure</h5><p>Several supporting devices are used to maintain MFC performance, depending on the reactor design. The most common supporting devices used in a double-chamber MFC are an air pump in the cathodic chamber and a magnetic stirrer in the anodic chamber. The cathodic chamber used an air pump to supply continuous and sufficient oxygen to the cathodic substrate to perform a reduction reaction to form water. Failure of the air pump can cause insufficient oxygen in the cathodic chamber, which lowers the electricity production in the system. The magnetic stirrer at the bottom of the anodic chamber supports the microorganisms in the anodic substrate to maintain contact with the organic matter. The failure of this magnetic stirrer can reduce the electron production by microorganisms and lower the electricity generation in the MFC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref57\" id=\"context_ref_57_3d1c\">[57]</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3d2\"><h4>2) Fault Detection Method</h4><p>To date, only three methods have been proposed for detecting faults in MFC. The first two methods, proposed by Yan et al. and Fan <i>et al.,</i> using frequency doubling wavelet and fault tree MFC algorithm were criticized by Ma et al. <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref56\" id=\"context_ref_56_3d2\">[56]</a> According to them, the previous two methods cannot produce an accurate result and take longer to identify faults. Therefore, they proposed a \u201cMicrobial Fuel Cell Model\u201d to diagnose faults in MFCs. They used a three-layer wavelet packet decomposition method to determine the frequency range and an SOM neural network to construct a pattern classification <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref57\" id=\"context_ref_57_3d2\">[57]</a>.</p></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec4\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION IV.</div><h2>Design of MFC Reactor</h2></div><p>Reactor design plays a prominent role in the design of low-cost MFCs <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref58\" id=\"context_ref_58_4\">[58]</a>.

Dual Chamber MFC (DCMFC)</h3><p>The dual-chamber MFC (DCMFC), as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig8\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 8</a>, consists of two compartments, an anodic and a cathodic chamber separated by a PEM <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_4a\">[3]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref36\" id=\"context_ref_36_4a\">[36]</a>. The double chamber was the first introduced model but was later modified into a single chamber to reduce the material cost <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref39\" id=\"context_ref_39_4a\">[39]</a>. To date, many types of dual-chamber MFCs have been presented. The H-type MFC is the most commonly designed DCMFC, consisting of two compartments connected by a membrane bridge in the middle. The anodic chamber is anaerobic, where the oxidation process produces electrons and the reduction process occurs in the cathodic chamber to produce clean water <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_4a\">[3]</a>. The DCMFC is the most suitable design for educational purposes because it consists of a comprehensive system with all essential components of the MFC. However, it is not cost-effective compared with a single-chamber MFC, which can be constructed at a lower cost.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig8\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share8-3227433-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig8\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share8-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 8. - Dual-Chamber MFC.\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">FIGURE 8. </b><fig><p>Dual-Chamber MFC.</p></fig></div><p class=\"links\"><a href=\"/document/9973315/all-figures\" class=\"all\">Show All</a></p></div></p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec4b\"><h3>B. Single Chamber MFC (SCMFC)</h3><p>A single-chamber MFC (SCMFC), as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig9\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 9</a>, was modified from the double-chamber design to reduce the cost and connect the cathode directly to air to absorb free oxygen <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref39\" id=\"context_ref_39_4b\">[39]</a>. This configuration removes the cathodic chamber but maintains other components such as electrodes, PEM (optional), microorganisms, and mediators. This design is simple and low-cost compared to other configurations. Some SCMFCs use a PEM as a separator between the anode and cathode chambers, but most SCMFCs are designed without a PEM <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref60\" id=\"context_ref_60_4b\">[60]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref62\" id=\"context_ref_62_4b\">[62]</a>. The membrane-less SCMFC is the most economical design, and the main cost of the MFC design for the PEM has been discarded. However, SCMFCs have a lower coulombic efficiency owing to oxygen diffusion into the anode.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig9\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share9-3227433-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig9\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share9-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 9. - Single-Chamber MFC.\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">FIGURE 9. </b><fig><p>Single-Chamber MFC.</p></fig></div><p class=\"links\"><a href=\"/document/9973315/all-figures\" class=\"all\">Show All</a></p></div></p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec4c\"><h3>C.

An et al. introduced multiple single-chamber, membrane-less MFCs stacked vertically to produce a high power density. First, they designed a cylindrical single-chamber MFC in which a graphite plate anode was placed at the bottom and covered by a rigid graphite plate as the bottom cap. The cathode was placed on top using graphite felt and exposed to air. Each compartment had an inlet for influents below the outlet for the affluent. Each cell was then connected vertically to form a stacked MFC. A copper wire was connected to the top cathode and bottom part of the anode (rigid graphite). The design is shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig17\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 17</a> <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref71\" id=\"context_ref_71_4i1\">[71]</a>.

The main aim of this model is to remove the disinfection of clean water after treatment. This model consists of an anodic chamber with multiple anodes arranged in a horizontal position and biologically synthesized silver nanoparticle cathodes in a cathodic chamber placed slanted so that the liquid from the anode could flow down without any external equipment <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref36\" id=\"context_ref_36_4i2\">[36]</a>.

Electrical Properties of MFCS</h3><p>Voltage and current are two significant quantities that play a prominent role in any electric circuit. The work done to move a positive charge from the low-potential point (negatively charged) to the high-potential point (positively charged) was defined as the voltage. In comparison, the rate of electron flow through a point in a closed circuit is defined as the current. The directions of the current and electrons are opposite <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref84\" id=\"context_ref_84_5c\">[84]</a>. Electrons flow from the negatively charged point to the positively charged end <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref85\" id=\"context_ref_85_5c\">[85]</a>.</p><p>There are three types of generators used to produce current in an electrical circuit: (a) chemical-based generators, (b) electromagnetic generators, and (c) thermoelectric generators. The MFC uses chemicals to generate voltage and current. Generally, an electrolyte is oxidized in a chemical-based generator to produce both negative and positive ions. When two metal plates are dipped into this electrolyte, the positive ion is attracted to one metal and the negative ions are attracted to another metal. If these two metals are connected using an external resistor, current is generated by moving electrons and ions <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref84\" id=\"context_ref_84_5c\">[84]</a>.</p><p>The electric current (I) is the number of electrons passing through a certain point in an electric circuit for one second from the positive terminal to the negative terminal <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref86\" id=\"context_ref_86_5c\">[86]</a>. The anode is a high-potential area that is rich in electrons. Therefore, the cathode becomes a positively charged area with fewer electrons and attracts more electrons, which carry a negative charge. Therefore, the number of electrons flowing from the anode to the cathode determines the amount of electric current produced in the circuit.

The substrate concentration, pH, and temperature are the three main factors that influence the reaction rate of the anodic chamber (other factors are negligible at this stage). At high substrate concentrations (pH between 7.0\u20139.0, and temperature of 25\u2013<inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$35~^{\\circ }\\text{C}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>), the oxidation process in the anodic chamber can produce a high volume of electrons and protons. These electrons are attracted to the anode and then move to the cathode, generating an electric current. Simultaneously, the protons moved to the cathodic chamber across the PEM. The electrons and protons accumulated in the cathodic chamber react with oxygen gas to produce water molecules. If these parameters (concentration, pH, and temperature) are maintained at optimal levels, the redox process will continuously generate an electric current in the circuit. Unfortunately, if any of these parameters are changed or dropped, the number of electrons and protons produced in the anodic chamber is reduced. This situation affects current generation in the circuit, and a voltage drop occurs until the system malfunctions.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec5c2\"><h4>2) Electron and Proton Transfer Mechanism in Series-Stacked MFC</h4><p>Electrons and protons are not transferred within their compounds when connected in series. <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig22\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 22</a> shows three air-cathode MFCs connected in series to explain this situation. The anode of MFC-1 (A-1) was connected to the cathode of MFC-3 (C-3). Similarly, the anode from MFC-2 (A-2) was connected to C-1, and the anode from MFC-3 (A-3) was connected to C-2. In the initial stage, the parameters (concentration, temperature, and pH) for all three MFCs were maintained at a common point. Thus, the number of protons and electrons (N number of protons and electrons) produced in all three MFCs was the same. Therefore, the N number of electrons from A-1 and the N number of protons from MFC-3 move to C-3.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig22\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share22-3227433-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig22\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973315/share22-3227433-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 22. - Three MFCs connected in series.\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">FIGURE 22. </b><fig><p>Three MFCs connected in series.</p></fig></div><p class=\"links\"><a href=\"/document/9973315/all-figures\" class=\"all\">Show All</a></p></div></p><p>All of these particles are fully reduced by oxygen to produce water molecules, and cathode C-3 becomes empty to receive new electrons and protons. If the chemical parameters are the same in all three MFCs, there is no issue because the same number of electrons and protons are accumulated in C-1 and C-2 to produce water by the reduction process. However, the system becomes imbalanced when any of the reactor\u2019s chemical reactions become sluggish owing to the low concentration or invalid pH and temperature values.</p><p>For example, the substrate in MFC-2 had a lower concentration than the other two MFCs. Therefore, the number of electrons and protons produced in MFC-2 was less than those in MFC-1 and MFC-3. Therefore, the number of electrons transferred to C-1 (from A2) is less than the number of protons received by C-1 (from MFC-1). When the number of protons exceeds the number of electrons, the reduction process uses the lowest number of particles to produce water. In this situation, C-1 had an excess of protons. Simultaneously, fewer protons from MFC-2 are transferred to C-2 through the PEM, while C-2 receives more electrons from A-3, resulting in excess electrons in C-2 after reduction. The accumulation of electrons in C-2 makes it a negatively charged electrode and prevents the attraction of more electrons from A-3. At one point, C-2 becomes the anode and A-3 becomes the cathode. Therefore, voltage reversal occurred between C-2 and A-3, giving the system a negative voltage. If this situation is not rectified and controlled at the initial stage, it will damage the electrodes and the system will fail. The same issue can occur in MFC with different pH and temperature values. Therefore, to avoid this issue, all parameters in all MFCs should be maintained at the same level. Unfortunately, maintaining each reactor with a standard operational parameter is not an easy task for MFCs as they consist of complex mixtures.</p></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec6\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION VI.</div><h2>Voltage Reversal in Stacked MFC</h2></div><p>The main drawback of MFC is that the amount of power generated by a single cell is ultra-low, making it challenging to boost it through power electronic circuits <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref4\" id=\"context_ref_4_6\">[4]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref87\" id=\"context_ref_87_6\">[87]</a>.

The stacked system without a diode generates a maximum of 0.8V with a 500-ohm resistor for 17 hours compared to 1.06V if connected separately.

When the diodes are forward-biased, the voltage of one MFC is reversed and the total voltage of the stacked MFC decreases to 0.35V, caused by the resistance and voltage reversal of the diode. When diodes are connected in reverse bias, voltage reversal still occurs in one MFC, whereas the other two MFCs generate 0.75V, suggesting that voltage reversal will occur with and without diodes. In addition, the diodes generate extra voltage drops in the stacked MFC.

Critical Review of VR Control Method in Current Literature</h3><p>Current literature still shows a lack of solid design to control or eliminate voltage reversal in stacked MFC. The main issue in serially connected MFC is the occurrence of reversal polarity in one or more unit cells of the system. Therefore, an electronic control method is required to eliminate VR in stacked MFC. The control methods discussed in the previous sections (VI-B-2 to 6) are good examples of electronically controlled MFC systems. However, using passive electronic components, such as diodes, resistors, and capacitors, generates more power losses in the system. Therefore, the system design must have fewer passive components.</p><p>A capacitor using a microcontroller to control the switches to charge and discharge was a good attempt by Kim et al. However, the numerous switches used in this design can result in high power losses in the system. One similarity in all the control methods is that they focus only on the output parameter, which is the voltage and power generation in the system.</p><p>However, the author strongly agrees (discussed in sections IV- A) that the main reason for VR in series stacked MFC is non-identical input parameters such as substrate concentration, temperature, and pH value of the individual cells. Therefore, balancing the input parameters is a primary concern in eliminating VR in the stacked MFC. Therefore, an artificial automatic control system is required to maintain identical input parameters in a stacked MFC. For this purpose, the author recommends using a low-cost microcontroller with multiple input sensors to measure, detect, and modify the input parameters of each cell in the stacked MFC.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec7\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION VII.</div><h2>Challenges and Future Direction of the MFC</h2></div><p>A report from Statistics MRC <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref98\" id=\"context_ref_98_7\">[98]</a> announces that the MFC market is expected to reach <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\$ $\n</tex-math></inline-formula>22.38 Million by 2026, which accounts for 11.2% growth in ten years, with biosensors, wastewater treatment, and education industries contributing significant factors for this growth. Unfortunately, low-power generation and high-cost materials remain significant challenges for the growth of MFCs in the future. In recent years, research on MFC has shifted slightly toward low-cost designs using low-cost membranes, membrane-less reactors, and air-cathode MFCs <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref99\" id=\"context_ref_99_7\">[99]</a>. However, apart from the material cost, operational cost is also becoming a significant issue in scaling up MFCs. To reduce the operational cost, Tommasi et al. <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref100\" id=\"context_ref_100_7\">[100]</a> analyzed the energy sustainability of various MFCs and suggested that a sediment MFC (Benthic MFC) is suitable as a low-cost MFC.</p><p>Although power generation in MFC is very low, they can still be used for low-power gadgets such as mobile phones, biosensors, and laptops.

However, stacking several MFCs in series or parallel connections is more effective in an electronic control system. Thus, the involvement of electrical engineers is crucial for developing a power management system for MFC to generate an adequate and stable power output. However, a new design of integrated circuits (ICs) and electronic control units will open a new path for advancing MFC design to solve global energy needs <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref101\" id=\"context_ref_101_7\">[101]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref102\" id=\"context_ref_102_7\">[102]</a>.</p></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec8\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION VIII.</div><h2>Conclusion</h2></div><p>Despite many challenges, MFCs have considerable advantages in replacing the current electrical energy generation for various applications. MFCs are the only technology that can remove pollutants while producing electrical energy directly from chemical energy. The drastic change in research and development of MFC in the last 20 years shows the growing popularity of this technology among researchers. Removal of pollutants while generating electricity, direct chemical to electrical energy, performance under mild conditions, easy customization, no sludge aeration, lower sludge treatment, self-regeneration of microorganisms, and water reclamation are some advantages of MFC. At the same time, some critical issues in MFC, such as ultra-low power generation, high-cost materials, high internal resistance, membrane fouling, electrochemical limitations, and mass transport limitations, prevent it from becoming the primary source of power generation.</p><p>Three main chemical properties influence MFC performance: substrate concentration, temperature, and pH value. At the same time, modifying the reactor design was found to improve MFC. MFCs use a redox reaction to produce electrons and protons and transfer them from the anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber to generate current and voltage. However, a single cell can only generate a maximum of 1.1 V, well below the required voltage of many electronic appliances. An attempt to stack MFCs in series or parallel is a solution to increasing the total voltage and current; however, voltage reversal occurs in the system and reduces the total voltage and current.</p><p>Fuel starvation and high current density are the primary reasons for the VR of stacked MFCs. Some literature reviews have deduced that maintaining each cell\u2019s chemical properties (substrate concentration, temperature, and pH) at a standard level will prevent VR in stacked MFC. The main issue in stacked MFC (series-stacked) is that the electrons and protons transferred to the cathodic chamber are not from the same cells. Therefore, when the chemical properties in each cell are not the same, the number of electrons and protons arriving at the cathodic chamber may vary, possibly generating excess electrons and protons in the cathodic chamber and producing voltage reversal.</p><p>Much research has been conducted In the past ten years to prevent VR using electronic control circuits, power management systems (PMS), and voltage boosting. However, most designs use resistors and diodes to introduce more power loss in the system. Using capacitors and transistors with a microcontroller could be a better solution for preventing VR in a series of stacked MFC. Solving the VR issue in a series of stacked MFC using a comprehensive electronic control unit may become a significant factor in boosting this technology in the commercial world. In addition, reducing material and operational costs will promote future implementation of MFCs as they have a wide range of applications as future power sources. Therefore, continuous research and development to improve this technology is critical for the future of global energy.</p></div>\n</div></div></response>\n"
