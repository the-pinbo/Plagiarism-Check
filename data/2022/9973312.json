It is expected that they have a high potential to change our entertainment and working behavior. A head-mounted display (HMD) devices are commonly used to provide AR/VR experience. With the advancement of AR/VR technology, HMD devices have been steadily developed. Especially, the performance of the display has become important in order to provide more realistic and immersive environment. Due to the advantages of high contrast ratio, color reproduction, and flexibility, emissive displays have been expected to play a stronger role in next-generation HMD devices <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_1\">[3]</a>.</p><p>Emissive displays, in which each pixel in the display is a light emitter, are emerging in the display market. Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and micro light-emitting diode (micro-LED) displays are representative emissive displays. They are used in various applications such as HMD, smartphones, tablets, and televisions. Emissive displays have several advantages such as thinness, high contrast, power efficiency, and flexibility <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref4\" id=\"context_ref_4_1\">[4]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref5\" id=\"context_ref_5_1\">[5]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref6\" id=\"context_ref_6_1\">[6]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref7\" id=\"context_ref_7_1\">[7]</a>. For example, OLED displays consume less power than liquid crystal displays (LCDs) with the same perceived brightness as displays for mobile devices <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref8\" id=\"context_ref_8_1\">[8]</a>. For those reasons, LCDs have recently been replaced by OLED displays in mobile devices. Nevertheless, a display itself is still one of the major power consumers in mobile devices <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref9\" id=\"context_ref_9_1\">[9]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref10\" id=\"context_ref_10_1\">[10]</a>. Power efficiency is an important issue in mobile devices. Therefore, numerous techniques are currently being studied in various approaches to reduce the power consumption of emissive displays.</p><p>In contrast to LCDs, in which power consumption is affected by the backlight, the power consumption of emissive display is dependent on the electric current flowing through each subpixel. Thus, the power consumption of emissive displays is affected by the color and brightness of the image and the pixel density <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref11\" id=\"context_ref_11_1\">[11]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref12\" id=\"context_ref_12_1\">[12]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref13\" id=\"context_ref_13_1\">[13]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref14\" id=\"context_ref_14_1\">[14]</a>. Dong and Zhong attempted to reduce power consumption using color transformation techniques that change the color schemes of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref12\" id=\"context_ref_12_1\">[12]</a> and web pages <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref14\" id=\"context_ref_14_1\">[14]</a>. They work similarly to the dark theme or dark mode, which are used in smartphones. These techniques can effectively reduce power consumption, but they can only be used for certain content. Adjustment of the color and brightness of an image is a simple and effective method for saving power. However, it should be applied carefully because color and brightness are strongly related to image quality. To address this issue, two approaches have been considered: one approach is to adjust the color and brightness to a level unnoticeable to the observer. Park and Song proposed a color blending scheme that reduces brightness while minimizing the degradation of visual impact <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref15\" id=\"context_ref_15_1\">[15]</a>. Choi et al. described the technique of adaptive color saturation based on the principle of a just noticeable color difference <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref16\" id=\"context_ref_16_1\">[16]</a>. In addition to these techniques, contrast enhancement <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref17\" id=\"context_ref_17_1\">[17]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref18\" id=\"context_ref_18_1\">[18]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref19\" id=\"context_ref_19_1\">[19]</a> and tone mapping method <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref20\" id=\"context_ref_20_1\">[20]</a> have achieved power savings while minimizing degradation of image quality. Another approach is to adjust the color or brightness of the unperceived area of the display. Some methods operate by turning off subpixels either in the GUI <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref21\" id=\"context_ref_21_1\">[21]</a> or in the screen areas covered by the user\u2019s fingers <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref22\" id=\"context_ref_22_1\">[22]</a>. Local dimming techniques based on visual attention have also been reported to reduce power consumption without the visual degradation of image quality <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref23\" id=\"context_ref_23_1\">[23]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref24\" id=\"context_ref_24_1\">[24]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref25\" id=\"context_ref_25_1\">[25]</a>. They efficiently reduced power consumption by darkening the less important area on the screen. However, they have limitations because the darkened area is still visible to the user.</p><p>To overcome these problems, we studied a low-power display technique based on gaze tracking called peripheral dimming <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref26\" id=\"context_ref_26_1\">[26]</a>. It aims to be a gaze-contingent technique that works in response to the user\u2019s gaze position. The darkened area would be barely noticeable to the user. As a result, it can maintain perceived image quality while reducing power consumption. This low-power technique for emissive displays requires an eye tracking. HMD systems have evolved towards incorporating multiple sensors for various capture, tracking, and other functions. Especially, the eye tracking is expected to be one of them <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref27\" id=\"context_ref_27_1\">[27]</a>. Thus, it is expected that eye-tracker integrated HMD devices will become common. Whereas these developments have provided users with more improved experience, they have also led to higher power consumption. Thus, in terms of saving power consumption, our technique will be useful to the HMD devices.</p><p>The peripheral dimming technique divides an image into two zones: a central zone and a peripheral zone. The central zone is a circular area centered on the gaze point and the peripheral zone is the area outside the central zone. The pixels in the central zone maintain their image data without any modification. On the other hand, the luminance in the peripheral zone gradually decreases as the distance from the end of the central zone to the gaze position increases. In our previous study <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref26\" id=\"context_ref_26_1\">[26]</a>, the size of the central zone was determined to be 10\u00b0, which sufficiently covers the fovea (~5\u00b0) and parafovea (~5\u00b0\u20139\u00b0) <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref28\" id=\"context_ref_28_1\">[28]</a>. Because, however, the HMD device has a wide field of view (FoV) of 100\u00b0 or more, it is possible that the central zone size (CZS) of 10\u00b0 may not be an optimal condition. Thus, we decided to investigate both the validity of the technique under a wide FoV environment and the effects of the CZS on the peripheral dimming technique. under a wide FoV environment.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the threshold dimming levels and power-saving efficiency (<inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta _{\\mathrm {power}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>) depending on CZS. Herein, the threshold is defined as a maximum dimming level where the observer cannot notice any changes in the brightness of the image. Threshold levels for three CZSs were obtained through a psychophysical experiment. The effects of the CZS were investigated using statistical analyses.</p></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec2\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION II.</div><h2>Peripheral Dimming Technique</h2></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec2a\"><h3>A. Motive</h3><p>A human visual field is distinguished into two main areas: foveal and peripheral visions. Lots of studies have reported that two visual fields have different visual characteristics. It is known that the difference is caused by non-uniform spatial distribution of photoreceptors <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref28\" id=\"context_ref_28_2a\">[28]</a>. The cone cells that mediate photopic vision are densely packed in the fovea and rapidly decrease in number toward the periphery of the retina <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref29\" id=\"context_ref_29_2a\">[29]</a>. Thus, as widely known, the foveal vision has significantly higher visual acuity and spatial resolution than peripheral vision. Furthermore, it has been reported that the peripheral vision has relatively weaker perception of size, color, brightness than the foveal vision <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref30\" id=\"context_ref_30_2a\">[30]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref31\" id=\"context_ref_31_2a\">[31]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref32\" id=\"context_ref_32_2a\">[32]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref33\" id=\"context_ref_33_2a\">[33]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref34\" id=\"context_ref_34_2a\">[34]</a>. A study that brightness-difference threshold increases with increasing eccentricity attracted our attention <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref34\" id=\"context_ref_34_2a\">[34]</a>. For this reason, we assumed that users might not notice any visual difference even brightness decreases in their peripheral vision. If image data are darkened in the peripheral vision, power consumption of the display could be saved while maintaining the perceived image quality.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec2b\"><h3>B. Perceived Brightness</h3><p>The peripheral dimming technique achieves power savings by gradually reducing brightness in the peripheral vision area. In other words, it reduces luminance of the corresponding display area. Visual perception is not proportional to luminance <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref35\" id=\"context_ref_35_2b\">[35]</a>. Human perception of changes in luminance would vary depending on current luminance value. For example, the human eyes sensitively notice luminance changes of dark images. On the other hand, they are less sensitive to detecting luminance changes of bright images. In addition, the luminance level depends on the devices. For universal application of the technique, image and device-independent brightness condition is essential. Thus, we determined dimming conditions based on the visual perception instead of luminance. Brightness refers to the perceived amount of light, but it is not suitable to the technique because it is a non-quantitative reference to physiological sensations <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref36\" id=\"context_ref_36_2b\">[36]</a>. To quantitatively reflect human visual perception, the CIELAB color space was used in the technique. This color space was proposed for a perceptually uniform space where a given numerical change corresponds to a similar perceived change in color. It consists of three components of L*, a*, and b*. Herein, a* and b* together represent chroma, and L* indicates lightness intended to match a subjective perception of light. The lightness component (L*) can be calculated by <a ref-type=\"disp-formula\" anchor=\"deqn1-deqn2\" href=\"#deqn1-deqn2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">(1) and (2)</a>:<disp-formula id=\"deqn1-deqn2\" class=\"display-formula\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">\\begin{align*} L^{\\ast }=&amp;116 h\\left ({\\frac {Y_{d}}{Y_{ref}} }\\right)-16,\\tag{1}\\\\ h\\left ({t }\\right)=&amp;\\begin{cases} \\displaystyle t^{\\frac {1}{3}}, &amp;t&gt;\\left ({\\frac {6}{29} }\\right)^{3} \\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac {1}{3}\\left ({\\frac {29}{6} }\\right)^{2}t+\\frac {4}{29},&amp; otherwise. \\end{cases}\\tag{2}\\end{align*}\n</tex-math><span class=\"formula\"><span class=\"link\">View Source</span><img aria-describedby=\"qtip-0\" style=\"display:inline;\" title=\"Right-click on figure or equation for MathML and additional features.\" data-hasqtip=\"0\" class=\"qtooltip moreInfo\" alt=\"Right-click on figure for MathML and additional features.\" src=\"/assets/img/icon.support.gif\" border=\"0\" height=\"20\" width=\"24\"/><span class=\"tex tex2jax_ignore\" style=\"display:none;\">\\begin{align*} L^{\\ast }=&amp;116 h\\left ({\\frac {Y_{d}}{Y_{ref}} }\\right)-16,\\tag{1}\\\\ h\\left ({t }\\right)=&amp;\\begin{cases} \\displaystyle t^{\\frac {1}{3}}, &amp;t&gt;\\left ({\\frac {6}{29} }\\right)^{3} \\\\ \\displaystyle \\frac {1}{3}\\left ({\\frac {29}{6} }\\right)^{2}t+\\frac {4}{29},&amp; otherwise. \\end{cases}\\tag{2}\\end{align*}\n</span></span></disp-formula> <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{Y}_{\\mathrm {d}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{Y}_{\\mathrm {ref}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> denote the luminance of a certain pixel and white pixel, respectively. The lightness value ranges from 0 to 100 that corresponds to from black to white, respectively.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec2c\"><h3>C. Lightness Reductino Ratio and Central Zone Size</h3><p><a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig1\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 1</a> illustrates a framework of the peripheral dimming technique. Firstly, the color space conversion is performed to obtain the L* values. An RGB color space is converted to the CIELAB color space. Thereafter, the L* values of the pixels are multiplied by the weight values that range from 0 to 1. <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 2(a)</a> shows an example of the weight map with the CZS of 10\u00b0. The weight value within the central zone is 1, and it linearly decreases outside the central zone. The degree of lightness reduction depending on the viewing is defined as the lightness reduction ratio (LRR). Herein, the lightness can also decrease non-linearly. However, a linear model which is the simplest condition was used for minimizing variables because it needs more time to find out the optimal model. Consequently, while maintaining the lightness of the central zone, the peripheral zone gradually is darkened with increased viewing angle. The weight map is computed based on the LRR value and is multiplied to the <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{L}\\ast $\n</tex-math></inline-formula> domain. Finally, the weight-applied CIELAB color space is converted to the RGB color space, and then the image is displayed.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig1\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973312/lee1-3227443-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig1\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973312/lee1-3227443-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 1. - Framework of the peripheral dimming technique.\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">FIGURE 1. </b><fig><p>Framework of the peripheral dimming technique.</p></fig></div><p class=\"links\"><a href=\"/document/9973312/all-figures\" class=\"all\">Show All</a></p></div>\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig2\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973312/lee2ab-3227443-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig2\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973312/lee2ab-3227443-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 2. - Examples of weight map underlying the peripheral dimming technique for the central zone sizes of (a) 10\u00b0 and (b) 40\u00b0.\"/><div class=\"zoom\" title=\"View Larger Image\"/></a></div><div class=\"figcaption\"><b class=\"title\">FIGURE 2. </b><fig><p>Examples of weight map underlying the peripheral dimming technique for the central zone sizes of (a) 10\u00b0 and (b) 40\u00b0.</p></fig></div><p class=\"links\"><a href=\"/document/9973312/all-figures\" class=\"all\">Show All</a></p></div></p><p><a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Figs. 2(a)</a> and <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">2(b)</a> show two weight maps for the same LRR but different CZS. The graphs describe the weight values of the horizontal pixels neighboring the fixation point. In the peripheral dimming technique, the degree of brightness reduction at the screen\u2019s edge depends on the central zone size. Even if the same LRR is applied, the smaller CZS results in a much darker edge of the screen as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 2(a)</a>. If darkening of the peripheral zone is noticeable, the LRR should be reduced. If then, that leads to a decrease in power-saving efficiency. Consequently, CZS may need to be adjusted appropriately depending on the FoV condition. To solve this issue, the effects of the CZS on the power-saving efficiency should be verified.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec3\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION III.</div><h2>Experiment</h2></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec3a\"><h3>A.

The monitor was placed 60 cm away from the chin rest. The horizontal and vertical fields of view were 76.2\u00b0 and 47.6\u00b0, respectively. A screen-based eye tracker was used to monitor the participants\u2019 gaze positions. The recommended setup position of the eye tracker was under the display. Thus, to accurately detect the participant\u2019s eyes, it was placed at the bottom of the screen. The gaze data were recorded at a sampling rate of 60 Hz.

Experimental Procedure</h3><p>Participants fixed their heads on the chin rest during the experiment. The eye-tracker was then calibrated for each participant. Prior to the experiment, the participants performed a short training session. In the training session, the participants experienced two things: an allowed gaze zone and a high LRR condition. We informed participants that a beep sounds when their gaze is outside the allowed gaze zone. They were asked to concentrate again and to gaze at the center when the beep sounds. The allowed gaze zone was an invisible circular area centered on the fixation point with a size of 8\u00b0. The beep sounded at every moment when the gaze moves out of the fixation window, at every second if the gaze stays outside the allowed gaze zone. If the beep sounded more than three times within one trial, the answer was not recorded and the trial with the same conditions was repeated. Next, a test image with a high LRR was presented to participants as an example. Every participant could easily notice the lightness difference between the reference and high LRR images, which helped the participants to understand the experimental procedure. The CZS was randomly selected at either 10\u00b0, 25\u00b0, or 40\u00b0. The trial sequence was repeated until the termination condition for the 1u3d staircase method was satisfied. To prevent the fatigue effect, there was a one-minute break for every six reversals. When the 1u3d staircase was completed for one size of central zone, the participants took a break for two minutes. Thereafter, a 1u3d staircase with different CZSs was performed. The entire procedure, including the short training session and breaks, took approximately 105 minutes per participant.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec4\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION IV.</div><h2>Results</h2></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec4a\"><h3>A.

Effect of the CZS</h3><p><a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig6\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 6(a)</a> showed interesting results that the change in CZS affected the individual variations as well as the mean value of LRR<sub>TH</sub>. We think that it was due to the property of the staircase method used in the experiment. In the staircase method, as described in <a ref-type=\"table\" anchor=\"table1\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Table 1</a>, a fixed step size of LRR was used. The size of the peripheral zone is inversely proportional to the size of the central zone. Thus, even if the LRR is slightly changed under the small CZS, the overall lightness of the image would change more significantly than a larger CZS. For that reason, although the step size of the LRR was the same for all CZS conditions, the overall lightness change of the image was not the same. The minimum AL change under the CZS of 10\u00b0 may have been large enough to be noticed even by the participants who are visually insensitive. On the other hand, the minimum AL change under the large CZS condition may be a subtle brightness change relatively. We think that this factor led to differences in the results between the visually sensitive and insensitive groups, and thus, the distribution was broadened under the large CZS condition.</p><p>In <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig6\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 6(b)</a>, it was observed that the average LRR<sub>TH</sub> was positively correlated with the CZS. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta _{\\mathrm {power}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> depending on CZS as described in <a ref-type=\"table\" anchor=\"table3\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Table 3</a>. This finding demonstrates that an CZS of 10\u00b0 is applicable even in a wide FoV environment, and that the peripheral dimming technique can achieve consistent energy efficiency regardless of the CZS. Therefore, the size of the central zone can be flexibly determined depending on the target applications or content. Each size of the central zone has its pros and cons. For example, a large distribution in LRR<sub>TH</sub> was observed with increased CZS conditions. From the viewpoint of determining the LRR<sub>TH</sub> value, the large CZS might be worse due to a difficulty to determine the representative value. Consequently, it may be necessary to determine the value of LRR more conservatively when the technique is applied with a larger CZS. On the other hand, when the small CZS is applied, if the image processing speed does not keep up with the rapid eye movement, such as saccadic eye movement, the dimmed area may be seen in the fovea more easily. This problem would be more noticeable with small CZS. Thus, a large CZS could have an advantage in this issue. Thus, the CZS should be determined taking these characteristics into account.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec5c\"><h3>C. Consistency of Al Changes</h3><p>Contrary to the results of LRR<sub>TH</sub>, interestingly, the average lightness (AL) of the image adopting LRR<sub>TH</sub> had a steady distribution even if the CZS was different as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig7\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 7(b)</a>. We tried to find an appropriate LRR<sub>TH</sub> depending on various conditions to apply the peripheral dimming without degradation of the perceived image quality. Fortunately, the AL of the image could be a key factor for the technique. LRR<sub>TH</sub> depends on CZS. Thus, to estimate an appropriate LRR value that meet the conditions is not easy. If the AL change is consistent or has a common trend for other images, it could be feasible to estimate LRR<sub>TH</sub> by computing the AL change. If then, an appropriate LRR condition can be estimated more easily. That assumption is based on consistent AL changes, but there is a difficulty to verify it in this study. Therefore, further studies should be performed to verify this hypothesis.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec5d\"><h3>D. Experimental Limitations</h3><p>Our findings were obtained for a monochromic image as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig4\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Fig. 4(a)</a>. The colors are strongly related to the brightness perception. The Helmholtz\u2013Kohlrausch effect, which is a perceptual phenomenon wherein the intense saturation of spectral hue is perceived as part of the color\u2019s luminance, is an example. Thus, we could not generalize the experimental results for full color images. The expected power-saving efficiency of the technique might be limited to monochromatic images. However, the fundamental principle to reduce the luminance of the peripheral zone will be still valid. Therefore, although the efficiency of the technique may vary depending on the type of image, it will succeed to reduce the power consumption of the displays.</p><p>The FoV condition used in the experiment was <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$76.2^{\\circ }\\times 47.6^{\\circ }$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>. Even though the FoV was improved compared to the previous study <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref26\" id=\"context_ref_26_5d\">[26]</a>, it was still smaller than the current HMD devices with the FoV of approximately 100\u00b0. Our FoV condition was limited due to the operating distance of the eye tracker. Our findings indicated that the AL change is consistent. Thus, it is considered that the <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta _{\\mathrm {power}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> for the same image will remain constant even as the FoV increases. However, contrary to our expectations, the impact of FoV may be significant. This is possible because the reduction in lightness of the image increases as the FoV is larger. This issue should be verified through the experimental data in our future work.</p><p>The peripheral dimming technique aims to be a gaze-contingent technique, so it requires eye tracking. Thus, if this additional component consumes power more than the technique saves, the technique could be meaningless. However, we think that the benefits from our technique would not be canceled out if the technique is applied to eye-tracker integrated HMD devices. Integrating an eye tracker in the HMD devices can offer various novel functions. For example, the eye tracking can be used for emotion recognition or health care such as clinical diagnosis <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref44\" id=\"context_ref_44_5d\">[44]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref45\" id=\"context_ref_45_5d\">[45]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref46\" id=\"context_ref_46_5d\">[46]</a>. To expand the application of the HMD device, the eye tracker would be a key component. Even today, either the wearable display devices with integrated eye tracker or the eye-tracking add-ons for HMD devices are on the market <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref47\" id=\"context_ref_47_5d\">[47]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref48\" id=\"context_ref_48_5d\">[48]</a>. Therefore, as mentioned in the introduction section, we believe that the eye-tracker integrated HMD devices will become pervasive. Consequently, if eye tracking technology becomes more common in HMD device, i.e. the power consumed in eye tracking is not an additional cost anymore, the peripheral dimming technique will effectively reduce the net power of the devices.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec6\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION VI.</div><h2>Conclusion</h2></div><p>In this study, the dependency of the CZS in the peripheral dimming technique was investigated. A psychophysical experiment with the CZSs of 10, 25, and 40\u00b0 was performed to determine the threshold conditions where power could be saved while maintaining perceived image quality. The experimental results showed that the average and standard deviation of LRR<sub>TH</sub> depend on the CZS. On the other hand, the differences in <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta _{\\mathrm {power}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> depending on the CZS were not statistically significant. It was demonstrated that the peripheral dimming technique with any CZS is feasible in a wide FoV environment. These findings indicate that the CZS can be adjusted flexibly depending on image content or the users\u2019 preference. The technique can reduce power consumption of the display panel by approximately 12% on average, up to 15% when it is applied aggressively. However, if the eye tracker is used by default such as HMD device with integrated eye tracker, the technique will help to reduce the net power of the device. HMD devices provide various content with a wide FoV and require low-power operation. Consequently, when eye-tracking HMD devices become pervasive, the peripheral dimming technique will be an attractive solution to save power consumption.</p></div>\n</div></div>\n"
