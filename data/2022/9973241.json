The distortion can be detected by sea mines or sensors. In order to avoid detection, ships can reduce their magnetic signature by degaussing <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref2\" id=\"context_ref_2_1\">[2]</a>. A degaussing system consists of a set of on-board copper coils which create an opposing magnetic field to that of the magnetic signature <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref3\" id=\"context_ref_3_1\">[3]</a>.</p><p>To create the degaussing field, a high magnetomotive force is needed. As a result, a significant amount of heat is dissipated in the copper degaussing coils because of the Ohmic losses. To eliminate these losses, the possibility of using high temperature superconductors (HTS) instead of copper degaussing coils is currently under investigation <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref4\" id=\"context_ref_4_1\">[4]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref5\" id=\"context_ref_5_1\">[5]</a>, <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref6\" id=\"context_ref_6_1\">[6]</a>.</p><p>A feature of HTS is that it can facilitate a much higher current density than copper. When a higher current is used, the number of turns can be reduced while still maintaining the needed magnetomotive force. This is useful because HTS tape is expensive and the large degaussing coils on a ship demand long lengths of wire. If the current exceeds the critical current of the tape, the superconductor goes out of its superconductive state. This should be avoided. Two problems arise when utilizing fewer turns with a higher current.</p><p>Firstly, the power supply for the HTS coils needs to deliver more current than for the copper coils. Current supplies typically dissipate more energy at higher current levels. This would make the HTS system less efficient than the copper system for the same magnetomotive force rating <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref7\" id=\"context_ref_7_1\">[7]</a>.</p><p>Secondly, current leads are needed to connect the source at room temperature to the HTS at cryogenic temperature. Through the current leads, heat leaks into the cryostat. The losses are expected to be significant <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref8\" id=\"context_ref_8_1\">[8]</a>. The current leads need to be able to handle the large current as well. In order to minimize Ohmic losses, they have to be designed with a sufficient cross-section. This causes more heat to leak into the cryostat which needs to be cooled away.</p><p>A solution to reduce the energy dissipation in the current source is to connect the HTS coil through an H-bridge topology. The idea is to avoid a forward voltage drop in series with the current path. By using MOSFETs with a low on-state resistance, the degaussing current will decay slowly during the discharge state because of the low resistance in the current path and the large inductance of the HTS degaussing coil <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref9\" id=\"context_ref_9_1\">[9]</a>. Because of the low resistance, we can use a small duty cycle. During the short charging state of the coil, there will be high energy dissipation in the source. However, during the long discharge state, almost no energy is dissipated.</p><p>A way to reduce the size of the current leads is to move part of the electronics inside the cryostat. This will reduce the rated current of the current leads, but it will introduce extra losses inside the cryostat. Also, a rectifier can be added in the cryostat so that the energy to the degaussing coils can be transferred by induction using a transformer. This would eliminate the need of current leads at all, but introduce even more losses in the cryostat because of the forward voltage of the rectifier. As a side effect, the MOSFET losses are decreased when they are placed inside the cryostat, because the on-state resistance can be lower at cryogenic temperatures <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref10\" id=\"context_ref_10_1\">[10]</a>. The extra heat that is introduced inside the cryostat needs to be lifted by the cooler. This is known to be very inefficient <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref11\" id=\"context_ref_11_1\">[11]</a>.</p><p>The objective of this paper is to investigate different possible current supply designs for a HTS degaussing coil. We will test the previously presented ideas to answer the following research questions:\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><li><p>Is it more energy efficient to move part of the electronics into the cryostat?</p></li><li><p>Is it more energy efficient to use a transformer in order to eliminate current leads?</p></li></ul></p><p>To answer these questions, we estimate and compare the efficiency of several converter topologies. This is done by identifying and quantifying the sources of loss in the power supply topologies. In addition to the the electrical losses, also the cryostat losses are taken into account. Only the loss sources which differ from topology to topology are taken into consideration. Measurements are conducted to find the performance of the MOSFETs and capacitors in liquid nitrogen.</p><p><a ref-type=\"sec\" anchor=\"sec2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Section II</a> defines the requirements for the power supply and presents the different converter topologies.

Requirements</h3><p>To compare different current source topologies, the specifications for the degaussing coils are needed. They are determined and taken from previous work <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref12\" id=\"context_ref_12_2a\">[12]</a>. A FEM model of a full-sized ship with 15 degaussing coils was constructed to find the rated current, <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I_{r}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>, and inductance, <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>, of the degaussing coils.

Topologies</h3><p>In this paper, we will consider a MOSFET-based H-Bride topology as the basic design for the converter. As needed, an H-bridge is able to provide the current in both directions. The rated degaussing current is quite high, so a device like an IGBT with a fixed voltage drop would have more losses than MOSFETs. For example, an IGBT with a forward voltage of <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {0.7~ \\text {V}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> that conducts <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {100~ \\text {A}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> will dissipate a power of <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {70~ \\text {W}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>. A MOSFET with an on-state resistance of 500 <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\Omega $\n</tex-math></inline-formula> only dissipates <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {5~ \\text {W}}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> for the same case. The on-state losses can even be lowered by placing multiple MOSFETs in parallel. <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig3\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Figure 3</a> shows the waveform of the current in the HTS coil. The low resistance in combination with the high inductance and no resistance of the HTS degaussing coil will cause the current to decay very slowly during discharge state, <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$t_{d}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>.

The source now only has to deliver current during the charging state, which is expected to be very short compared to the discharging state because of the large time constant of the degaussing coil in combination with the MOSFETs. The current leads have to be rated for the rated degaussing current <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I_{R}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec2b2\"><h4>2) Topology 2</h4><p>The HTS coil is placed inside the cryostat together with the H-Bridge as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">figure 2b</a>. The current leads can be made smaller because they only have to be sized for the RMS current during the cycle. The on-state resistance of the MOSFETs drops because they are placed inside the liquid nitrogen. This will reduce the duty cycle even further. However, the conduction and switching losses of the MOSFETs are dissipated inside the cryostat which adds to the cryostat losses.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec2b3\"><h4>3) Topology 3</h4><p>A smoothing capacitor is added inside the cryostat as shown in <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig2\" class=\"fulltext-link\">figure 2c</a>. This capacitor causes the current that flows through the current leads to change from short high current pulses, to a steady DC current. Now the source doesn\u2019t have to be able to deliver the rated current, <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I_{r}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>, anymore. It will also decrease the Ohmic losses in the current leads.

It can be seen that for topology 0, the main contributor is the loss in the current source. This part is so big, because the rated current constantly has to flow through the source. Also, the current leads are sized for the rated current. This makes the current lead losses high as well.</p><p>For topology 1, the source losses are considerably lowered compared to topology 0. This is because the rated current only flows from the source during the charge state. During the discharge state, the source current is zero. The current lead losses are still high, because the leads are still rated for the rated current. The circuit losses because of the MOSFETs and PCB are small, but present as well. The switching losses are insignificant, which is explained by the low switching frequency which is possible in this configuration.</p><p>For topology 2, the current leads can be made much smaller. This has a large effect on the power loss in the current leads. However, the circuit losses become much larger. This is because the components are now inside the cryostat, so a lot more cooling power is needed. Also, the switching losses happen inside the cryostat, but they are still very small compared to the other losses. It should be noted that the source losses also are a bit lower than for topology 1. This is because the resistance of the MOSFETs is lower in liquid nitrogen and therefore the duty cycle is lower as well.</p><p>For topology 3, the source and current lead losses are decreased even further. This is because the source current waveform is smoother which causes the RMS value of the source current to be lower than in the previous cases. The capacitor adds extra losses inside the cryostat, but these are insignificant.</p><p>For topology 4, a transformer is added to remove the current lead losses completely. However, the current lead losses were already very small in topology 3, so it does not have a large effect. There are extra transformer and rectifier losses inside the cryostat however. Also, the source losses are increased more. The total added losses are higher than in the previous case.</p><p>For the topologies in which the components are placed inside the cryostat, it seems that circuit losses, which include the on-state losses, become dominant because of the coefficient of performance of the cooler. A way to lower these losses is to place multiple MOSFETs in parallel so that the resistance is lower. <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig4\" class=\"fulltext-link\">Figuer 4b</a> shows the power balance of the topologies again, but now with ten parallel MOSFETs per switch. Now the circuit losses become much smaller. Also, the current lead losses and the source losses become smaller. This is because the lower resistance enables a lower duty cycle. To determine a right amount of parallel MOSFETs in the final design, <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig5\" class=\"fulltext-link\">figure 5a</a> shows the total power dissipation as a function of parallel MOSFETs. It can be seen that even by placing one extra MOSFET in parallel, the power can be decreased drastically. Placing more than ten MOSFETs in parallel does not seem to have a large impact on the final power use.\n<div class=\"figure figure-full\" id=\"fig5\"><!--\n          Workaround for combined images.Eg.- 1000116 Fig. 5\n        --><div class=\"img-wrap\"><a href=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973241/wikke5ab-3227508-large.gif\" data-fig-id=\"fig5\"><img src=\"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9973241/wikke5ab-3227508-small.gif\" alt=\"FIGURE 5. - (a) Added power of the loss sources as a function of parallel MOSFETs.

Besides energy-efficiency, this solution is also a practical one. The source does not have to be able to deliver the rated current so it can be made much smaller. The capacitor can be slowly charged during relatively long discharge times. Topology 4, which uses a transformer, does not add more advantages. Also, it adds more complexity to the circuit. It is not useful to use a transformer.</p></div><div class=\"section_2\" id=\"sec4b\"><h3>B. Switching Frequency</h3><p>In the analysis until now, the topologies use the lowest switching frequency possible while still meeting the current ripple requirement of <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {0.5~\\%}$\n</tex-math></inline-formula>. It can be argued that is useful to use a higher switching frequency so that the current ripple can be lowered. Also a higher switching frequency causes the ripple in the magnetic signature to be damped more <a ref-type=\"bibr\" anchor=\"ref12\" id=\"context_ref_12_4b\">[12]</a>. However, a higher switching frequency also causes more switching losses. For the topologies where the MOSFETs are placed inside the cryostat, the switching losses are even higher because of the coefficient of performance of the cooler. For an optimal design <a ref-type=\"fig\" anchor=\"fig5\" class=\"fulltext-link\">figure 5</a> shows the percentage that the switching losses are of the total amount of losses. For topology 1, where the MOSFETs are not placed inside the cryostat, it can be seen that the converter can operate above <inline-formula id=\"\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm {1~ \\text {k} \\text {Hz} }$\n</tex-math></inline-formula> without any problems. For the topologies where the MOSFETs are placed inside the cryostat, the switching losses become too high in this range. It should also be noted that a higher switching frequency in combination with the low duty cycle that is used in this topologies can cause problems. The on-state of the MOSFETs is very short compared to the off-state. If the frequency is also high, the on time of the MOSFET might be too short to switch.</p></div></div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec5\"><div class=\"header article-hdr\"><div class=\"kicker\">\n\t\t                        SECTION V.</div><h2>Conclusion</h2></div><p>Several converter topologies were investigated to be applied for HTS degaussing coils in this paper. Measurements were done to validate the performance of the electronic components in liquid nitrogen. It was shown that it is more energy efficient to place the MOSFETs inside the cryostat. By doing this, the rated current for the current leads is drastically decreased and therefore the losses as well. However, by placing the MOSFETs inside the cryostat, the cooler needs to lift more heat. This is an inefficient process. This can be counteracted by placing multiple MOSFETs in parallel so that the conduction losses inside the cryostat are limited. As a side effect of cooling and paralleling the MOSFETs, the time constant of the load increases. This is beneficial for the energy efficiency of the converter. By adding a smoothing capacitor inside the cryostat, the current leads can be made even smaller. This also limits the need for large peak currents from the current source. It is not useful to use a transformer to completely remove the current leads. The secondary coil and the rectifier inside the cryostat introduce more losses than that the elimination of the current leads yield. Besides, a transformer makes the circuit more complex.</p></div>\n</div></div>\n"
